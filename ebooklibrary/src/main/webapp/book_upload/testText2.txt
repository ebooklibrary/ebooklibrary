Parts of the Florida Gulf coast were under hurricane warnings as Hurricane Hermine rotated toward the state packing 75-mph winds Thursday night.

Gov. Rick Scott urged areas along a long stretch of the coast centered on the so-called Big Bend ? the elbow where the state's peninsula meets the Panhandle ? to lay in food and water and make sure they had shelter ahead of the "life-threatening" hurricane ? the first for the state since Wilma 11 years ago.

Hermine was "just looming off the coast" early Thursday night, said Ari Sarsalari, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel. "The whole Big Bend is in for a brutal night."

The National Weather Service said Hermine, which was centered about 45 miles south-southwest of Apalachicola at 8 p.m. ET, was expected to make landfall late Thursday or early Friday somewhere between Apalachicola and Horseshoe Beach.

                              Sandbags line the doors of a business in Cedar Key, Fla. in preparation of Tropical Storm Hermine, Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2016. Forecasters say Hermine could be near hurricane strength by Thursday night as it approaches the Gulf Coast.

Hannah Coles, 9, takes a break from riding her bike to feel a strong rain band rain shortly Thursday afternoon, Sept. 1, 2016 in Gulfport, Fla. Coles was taking advantage of the day off from school to play in the rain and flooding. Tropical Storm Hermine strengthened into a hurricane Thursday and steamed toward Florida's Gulf Coast.

Hurricane warnings were in effect for Suwannee, Hamilton and Lafayette counties, and watches extended north and south to cover almost half the state along the Gulf of Mexico.
Scott put 51 counties under a state of emergency and ordered all state offices closed Friday.

With a hurricane comes the reality of price-gouging for essentials. State Attorney General Pam Bondi activated Florida's emergency anti-price-gouging regulations, barring retailers from raising prices on gasoline, water, lumber and other necessities.

The National Weather Service said Hermine was expected to produce rainfall from 5 to 10 inches over much of northwest Florida and southern Georgia through Friday ? with possible localized deluges of 20 inches.

A combination of a dangerous storm surge and rising tides will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded, the weather service said, warning of "life-threatening inundation within the next 12 to 24 hours" along the Gulf coast from Indian Pass to Longboat Key.

"We have a hurricane," Scott said Thursday afternoon after visiting with emergency officials in Wakulla County. He announced that 6,000 National Guard members were on standby if needed.

In Wakulla County, in the middle of the Big Bend, "you can see the river ? the water is already coming in," Scott said. "We're going to see a lot of flooding down there."

"You can rebuild a home. You can rebuild property," he said. "You cannot rebuild a life."

Hours before Hermine's arrival, mandatory evacuations were already in effect in localized areas. A state of emergency was declared in Taylor County, on Apalachee Bay, and evacuations were ordered in several waterside communities,NBC station WTLV of Jacksonville reported.

Several neighborhoods in Franklin County, on Apalachicola Bay farther west, were also under a mandatory evacuation orders, including all of St George and Dog islands.

Waves from the Gulf of Mexico washed inland early Thursday evening, flooding Main Street in downtown Cedar Key, in Levy County, NBC station WBBH of Fort Myers reported. North of Tampa, a tornado warning was briefly in effect as fierce winds raced through ahead of the hurricane.

Rising water overwhelmed wastewater treatment plants in Sarasota County, NBC station WFLA of Tampa reported. David Cash, manager of the county's Public Utilities Division, said the plants were inundated with double the usual daily average of 14 million gallons of wastewater.

"If we have any failures, we can expect wastewater spills in some cases, backups in homes, so we're very concerned," Cash said.

More than 4,000 sandbags were filled and distributed to residents in a few hours at just one sandbag station in Ocala, in Marion County, NBC station WESH of Orlando reported.

"We've been doing this for a couple of days now," said sheriff's Lt. Chip Wildy, director of the county's emergency management bureau. "Unfortunately, we can't wait on the wind to start blowing."

But the wind was already creating problems across Florida, with worse yet to come.

The state Highway Patrol closed the Sunshine Skyway Bridge on Interstate 75 between St. Petersburg and Manatee County at 1 p.m. with winds averaging 46 mph and gusting to 56 mph.

Public schools and colleges in the storm's path announced that they were closing. The University of Florida in Gainesville canceled classes through Saturday morning, while Florida State University closed its main campus in Tallahassee at noon and said it would remain closed Friday.

Tropical Depression 9 strengthened into Tropical Storm Hermine in the Gulf of Mexico late Wednesday.

Hurricane and tropical storm warnings and watches were in effect for northwest Florida, parts of Georgia and the southeast corner of Alabama.

In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 56 counties, including parts of south, central and coastal Georgia. Even if Hermine doesn't make landfall there, the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency warned of heavy rains, flooding, tornadoes and power failures.

After making landfall, Hermine is likely to then travel up the coast, forecasters warned ? perhaps as far as Boston by Monday.

Skies were still sunny Thursday afternoon on North Carolina's Wrightsville Beach ? but red flags fluttered in the breeze, warning of the high risk of dangerous waters. Lifeguards said the warnings were likely to remain in place until Monday.

"Before and after, that is generally when we have the most issues," Wrightsville Beach Ocean Rescue Lt. Jon Mauney told NBC station WRAL of Raleigh. "You have beautiful weather conditions, but you have large swells, large breaking waves, and extremely strong rip currents."

Gov. Pat McCrory issued a state of emergency Thursday afternoon for 33 eastern counties, and a mandatory evacuation order was in place for Ocracoke Island.

"It could be a very lousy holiday weekend for a large part of the population," said Kevin Roth, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel.

Besides downed trees and flooding, the other risk Hermine brings to Florida is derailing the state's efforts against the Zika virus. Because Zika-carrying mosquitoes thrive in and around standing water, Scott told residents to empty any containers full of water as soon as it was safe to do so.

"You've heard the message with Zika. We want no standing water. Well, we're going to have standing water when this happens," he said.

Meanwhile, in Hawaii, Hurricane Madeline was downgraded to a tropical storm, and it skirted the island. Heavy rain hit parts of Hawaii, and strong waves pummeled shorelines as the still-powerful Pacific storm passed.

President Barack Obama asked fellow Hawaiians to heed the advice of officials ahead of an expected one-two punch of Tropical Storm Madeline and Hurricane Lester.

"We've been working with the governor and FEMA to make sure Hawaii's got everything it needs to keep our folks safe," he said at the Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders in Oahu, about 200 miles from the Big Island.

"I'd just ask the people of Hawaii to listen to your state and local officials and make sure you and your families are prepared for the storms," he said.
